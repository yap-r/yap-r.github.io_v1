When thinking about what books I want to put on my reading list for the next 13 months, I circle back to what I want to achieve from these lists. Particularly, for non-fiction books, how can they help me achieve the goals I want to achieve.

Key user stories:

1. As a reader of books, I want to include fiction books in my reading list, so that I am able to explore the more creative aspects of writing. For this, I propose that 1 in 3 books I read be fiction books.

2. As someone who will have excess time in December / January after the end of school, I want to set myself the goal of 2 books a week, which comes up to 8 books between mid-December and mid-January. Thereafter, 1 book every two weeks would be an ambitious target. That leaves me with 2 x 4 + 25 * 1 = 33 books. So 11 fiction and 22 non-fiction.

3. Now for the key goals I want to achieve in my life - in order of priority, I would state:
- Becoming better at understanding technology and products (3)
- Furthering my spiritual pursuits and figuring out what makes me happy (2)
- Becoming better at understanding how to plan my finances (2)
- Becoming more worldly in understanding socio-political dynamics (2)
- Learning from life lessons from people who have been there and done that (3)
- Learning how to live life (3)

4. Based off the above, I assign 22 books across these 5 categories. It seems like I am only prepared to list 15 books so far - I guess that leaves me space to choose 7 random books based on recommendations / lists. 

5. For fiction books, I have no clear idea how I will be selecting them. I guess, I will base it off what I see in the NY Times list - not very sophisticated but oh well.
